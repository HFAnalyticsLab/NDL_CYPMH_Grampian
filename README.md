# Networked Data Lab: NDL Grampian analysis on mental health prescribing and CAMHS referrals

#### Project Status: In-progress

## Project Description

- This Networked Data Lab analysis by the NDL lab in Grampian explores community mental health prescribing and specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) referral datasets which are linked at the individual level with demographic and socioeconomic information.
- This project aims to describe trends over time in prescribing and referrals and identify any differences between groups based on age, sex and area deprivation.
- Please note that these research outputs have not yet been peer-reviewed and should be treated as preliminary.

## Data sources

This analysis used the following data: 

- NHS Grampian subset of the [Prescribing Information System](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Prescribing-and-Medicines/Prescribing-Datamarts/#pis). This is a record of every prescription made or dispensed in the community (i.e. outside of hospitals).
- NHS Grampian CAMHS referrals. Records on referrals inform national reporting of [CAMHS waiting times](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-camhs-waiting-times/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-camhs-waiting-times-quarter-ending-31-december-2021/).
- [Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2020 v2](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/). Linked to place of residence via postcode.
- [Mid-year Populaation Estimates](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/2011-based-special-area-population-estimates/population-estimates-by-simd-2016). Officially produced by the National Records of Scotland and broken down by age, sex and SIMD for the calculation of rates.
